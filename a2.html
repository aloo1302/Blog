                Earlier ,I used to get flustered/mildly irritated  by the never ending stream of these GOOD MORNING messages which used to fill up my phone’s memory. I never really saw the point of sending these messages.

Those generic good morning messages with smileys, butterflies, flowers, sunrise etc.
<br><br>
There has been a drastic shift in my perspective ever since I started living in a hostel far far away from home.
<br><br>
As Indians its deeply ingrained in our psyche that those who express emotions are weak/soft.
<br><br>
There’s a sea of emotions which we are repressing ,which can’t always be expressed so a simple Good Morning or a few heart shape emojis become the convenient substitute.
<br><br>
The same messages which seemed irritating and pointless earlier now bring a slight smile on to my face before I even realize it.
<br><br>
But now i have realized that since in our culture we don’t express our love to our dear ones explicitly .(just saying i love you to parents/siblings might be super awkward for many).Sending these messages is just a way to keep in touch daily/just to start a conversation/to tell them we are thinking about them. 
<br><br>
Basically ,a its an expression of love , which can be endearing and mildly annoying at the same time.
<br><br>
So i guess its okay to forward few of them every now and then!
