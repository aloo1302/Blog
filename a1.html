            <h2>The Curious Case of KLR</h2>
            <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2022/08/KL-Rahul-AP333-C.jpg" alt="dejected KL Rahul">

            <p>i think we all have on twitter at some point of time taken a crack at KL Rahul for his inability to perform in crunch situations.<br><br>

                i have been one of these people. Though, i have never questioned his technical prowess (not that i have the knowledge/skill to do that). But people know that at his best he can take down any bowling attack.Lately his IPL SR has been falling as well,runs have dried up,he hasnt performed well when India needed him.<br><br>
                
                i have made comments  like for him its more of a "mind situation" ,once he’s sorted there he will perform,maybe he needs to talk to Paddy Upton.i have shared my share of memes which have often been quite sharp. i guess you can call me a “troll”.<br><br>
                
                deep down all of these “trolls” are KL Rahul fans who want to see him bat freely.
                
                its like someone with the power and capability of ferrari intentionally working like an auto rickshaw.
                
                it feels odd to the eye almost unbearable after a point.<br><br>
                
                The question is WHY? why is KL not performing. he was touted/ hyped as the next big thing and rightly so . but he never really arrived.
                
                its not like he himself isnt aware if the immense talent that he possesses. he knows that very well.everyone knows that . so whats missing? its not like he has never performed under pressure.quite a few times he has stepped up and performed and tough pitches. but yes ,in the recent its like his form completely deserts him when under pressure.<br><br>
                
                its like he has decided to live upto to the perception many have about it him.
                
                <br><br>this is what i thought till…<br><br>
                
                well to put it simply ,i myself failed to handle pressure. <br><br>
                
                yep.
                
                that kind of opened me a whole new perspective.
                
                why do we Indians love cricket so much?<br><br>
                
                the answer is vicarious success.
                
                we get a sense of achievement  from other people’s achievements which is otherwise lacking.
                
                when a team wins say LSG wins we feel like we have won. and it doesnt we feel like we have lost. and we search for someone to blame. we become so attached that we dont just put the blame on the person ,we nail it on him.
                
                <br><br> so i was giving a competitive exam myself a national level exam .
                
                prior to that i had given a few others and done pretty well in them. but this exam was clearly the most important and guess what : i choked. i had repeatedly told myself not to panic .i told myself do the easy questions ,dont get hung up on the difficult ones and yet i did.
                
                all my strategies and wisdom evaporated into thin air.
                
                though i still somehow managed to get into an NIT.<br><br>
                
                its very easy to point and say X/Y player never performs under pressure yada yada. but the point is its not easy.its not easy at all. 
                
                Just think about the pressure moments in your life and how you reacted at that time. in hindsight  you will always feel you could have done better or from a third person POV it will feel you didnt do the obvious.
                
                These players have come to this level after the extreme grind of the domestic circuit and the IPL and the more they perform the more we expect(classic indian parent mindset).
                
                <br><br>ig we all need to give KL Rahul some space to breathe and believe in him.
                
                He has the talent to be one of the best in the world, its not the question of if but “when”.
                
                he knows what to do ,how to it but things just arent falling into place.
                
                maybe fate has bigger plans for him.
                
                You know what they say,form is temporary ,KLass is permanent(han bhai aakash chopra fan hoon).
